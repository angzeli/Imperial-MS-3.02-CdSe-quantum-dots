This repository contains all experimental documents, analysis code, figures, and literature for the synthesis and optical characterisation of CdSe quantum dots (QDs). It includes the full laboratory script, references used in the analysis, Python scripts for data processing, and the viva presentation slides.
📌 Overview

This project investigates:
	•	CdSe quantum dot synthesis via the hot-injection method
	•	Optical characterisation using UV–Vis absorption, fluorescence emission, and excitation spectroscopy
	•	Extraction of key properties:
	•	Band-edge absorption peak
	•	Emission peak
	•	Stokes shift
	•	Quantum efficiency trends
	•	FWHM (spectral width)
	•	Band-gap energy E_g’
	•	Particle radius from the Brus Equation
	•	Growth mechanism analysis:
	•	Diffusion-controlled
	•	Surface-controlled
	•	Reaction-limited
	•	Ostwald ripening vs secondary nucleation
	•	Comparison across different Cd:Se precursor ratios (1.33:1, 1:3, 1:5)

The repository is fully reproducible and includes both raw and processed datasets.
